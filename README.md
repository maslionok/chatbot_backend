# Connector between chatwoot and customly prompted chatgpt Q&A system. 

## Current limitations:
- "Touching" people functionality is currently commented out, since without access to website code I cant make it pop automatically, and user needs to open the chat themselves anyway. 
- Current server hosting "Render" on free subscription goes to "sleep" after some inactivity resulting in a first request being pretty slow the first time.
